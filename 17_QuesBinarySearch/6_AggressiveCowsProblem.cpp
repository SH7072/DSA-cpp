// Problem Statement: There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows.
// The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,â€¦.,xN
// (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls,
// such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as
// large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?
